As an ambitious programmer, I focus on developing efficient solutions. With experience in `Typescript`, `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `Ruby on Rails`, `React.js`, and `React Native`, I bring a diverse skill set to the table.

My love for programming and logical thinking sparked at a young age and has been the driving force behind my career. I find great satisfaction in structuring databases and crafting front-end and back-end architectures. When I bring together my technical expertise and logical understanding, I aim to create code that's not just clean, but also scalable and easy to maintain.

In addition to my technical abilities, I am fluent in `Portuguese`, `English`, and `French`. This multilingual proficiency gives me the flexibility to work on international projects and navigate different cultural contexts seamlessly.
